# Let's Flute ðŸŽµ

A web-based rhythm game designed to teach children how to play the orchestral flute. Inspired by popular rhythm games like Guitar Hero and Dance Dance Revolution, it visually guides players through flute fingerings and rhythms using animated tracks and mirrored flute key diagrams.

## Features

- ðŸŽ® **Rhythm Game Mechanics**: Notes fall down the track toward a target line, just like Guitar Hero
- ðŸŽ¹ **Flute Key Diagram**: Visual representation of 7 flute keys with real-time feedback
- ðŸŽµ **Musical Learning**: Learn actual flute fingerings for different notes (C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C2)
- ðŸ“Š **Scoring System**: Track your performance with score and combo multipliers
- ðŸŽ¨ **Beautiful UI**: Gradient backgrounds, smooth animations, and color-coded notes
- ðŸ“± **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## How to Play

1. Press the **Start Game** button
2. Watch the colored notes fall down the track
3. Press the keyboard keys (A, S, D, F, G, H, J) that match the flute fingering when notes reach the red target line
4. Each note shows which keys you need to press simultaneously
5. Build combos by hitting notes accurately to maximize your score!

### Keyboard Controls

- **A, S, D, F, G, H, J**: Flute keys (left hand to right hand position)
- Notes require different combinations of keys based on actual flute fingerings

## Customization

### Adding Your Own Songs

Edit `flute-data.js` to add new songs:

```javascript
const MY_SONG = {
    title: "My Song Title",
    bpm: 120,
    notes: [
        { note: 'G', time: 0, duration: 1 },
        { note: 'A', time: 1, duration: 1 },
        // Add more notes...
    ]
};
```

Then update `game.js` to use your song:
```javascript
this.currentSong = MY_SONG;
```

### Adjusting Difficulty

In `game.js`, modify these values:

- `noteSpeed`: Higher = faster falling notes (default: 150)
- `hitWindow`: Smaller = more precise timing required (default: 0.15)
